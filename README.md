# Java_PacMan_game_project

A Java Pac-Man game project typically involves creating a simplified version of the classic Pac-Man arcade game using Java. In this project, you would expect the following key components: -
> Player Character (Pac-Man): Controlled by the user, moves around the maze collecting pellets while avoiding enemies (ghosts).
> Ghosts: AI-controlled enemies that chase Pac-Man. Each ghost may have different movement patterns or behaviors.
> Maze: A grid-like map with walls, paths, and dots. Pac-Man collects dots to score points.
> Power Pellets: Special items that allow Pac-Man to temporarily turn the tables and eat ghosts.
> Score System: Keeps track of points earned by collecting dots and eating ghosts.
> Game Logic: Includes win/loss conditions, such as clearing all dots to win or losing lives when caught by ghosts.
This type of project is great for learning Java programming concepts like object-oriented design, game loops, collision detection, and simple AI for ghost movement.
